## Vul. I.
There is a bug in Single [comparison](https://github.com/HackerDom/ructf-2021/blob/main/services/white_album/src/WhiteAlbum/Entities/Single.cs#L38), two instances of Single class are considered to be equal, when properties Name and Id are equal, but when comparison is called Name and Id firstly being cast to String and only then are compared. There are no explicit implementation .ToString() for Id and default .NET .ToString() implementation is just a type name, so calling .ToString() for any instance of will will produce same string. User can be successfully authorized to attach single to its own album, not only when they own that single, but when they are own any single with the same name. In order to have access to the other user single it is sufficient to create single with the same name and attach another users single to the album which user are honestly owning and then download every single attached to that album.

## Vul. II. 
There is a superadmin apikey, that gives you access to everything, it is stored in settings and generated randomly when there are no settings. But there are misspelling in the setting name and admin api key setting is optional, so default apikey with_this_api_key_you_have_access_to_everything are used.
