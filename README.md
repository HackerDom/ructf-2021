# RuCTF 2021

RuCTF is an annual Russian Open Student Information Security Championship.

The contest is driven by classic rules (Attack-Defense CTF). Each team is given a set of vulnerable services. Organizers regulary fill services with private information â€” the flags. The goal of each team is to find vulnerabilities, fix them in their services and exploit them in order to get flags from other teams.
